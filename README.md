I'm Heather Musson, a third year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I love all things frontend, and the creation of amazing user interfaces. I am always looking to learn cutting-edge technologies, and be a part of challenging projects. Currently, I am:

- 🏢 Working at Shopify as a Web Developer intern
- 📔 Improving my skills in ReactJS, GraphQL, and NodeJS
- 🎨 Learning <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> while designing and building several Shopify themes
- 👀 Looking for a Winter 2021 internship
