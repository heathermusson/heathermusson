I'm Heather Musson, a third year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I love all things frontend, and the creation of amazing user interfaces. I am always looking to learn cutting-edge technologies, and be a part of challenging projects. Currently, I am:

- 👀 Looking for a Fall 2021 internship <!-- 👀 Looking forward to my Winter 2021 internship at Facebook 🏢 Working at Shopify as a Web Developer intern -->
- 🔮 Reminiscing about my past internships at Facebook, Shopify, and Smile.io
- 📔 Improving my skills in ReactJS, GraphQL, and Ruby on Rails
- 👩 Working on my <a href="https://github.com/Team-Chicken-Nuggets/server">Final Year Design Project</a>
<!-- - 🎨 Learning <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> while designing and building several Shopify themes -->
